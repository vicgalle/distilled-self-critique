While the performances were commendable, particularly those from Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman, the overall execution felt uninspired and underwhelming.\n\nFurthermore, I found the film's message of hope and redemption to be overly simplistic and insincere. The narrative relies on tropes that have been overused in numerous movies before it, leaving little room for originality or depth. As a result, \"The Shawshank Redemption\" feels like an outdated movie trying too hard to capture the essence of an era long past.\n\nIn conclusion, while I acknowledge the film's historical significance and the talent of its actors, \"The Shawshank Redemption\" falls short in terms of cinematic storytelling and originality.

However, this film falls short in several aspects that ultimately leave viewers disappointed and unsatisfied.\n\nTo start, the plot lacks depth and complexity. The story revolves around a family's rise to power in the mafia, but it feels shallow and overly simplified. Characters are one-dimensional, lacking motivation or any real emotional investment. The film fails to explore the psychological aspects of crime and violence that are so crucial to understanding the mafia lifestyle.\n\nFurthermore, the acting in this film is subpar. Despite having some of Hollywood's most renowned stars, their performances lack genuine emotion or conviction. It is as if they were merely going through the motions without any real passion for their roles. The dialogue delivery is stilted and unconvincing at times, making it difficult to connect with the characters on an emotional level.\n\nThe cinematography and visual effects are also disappointing. The film appears dated and lacks the technical prowess of modern films in this genre. There is no sense of immersion or realism that one would expect from a movie set in such a gritty world.\n\nLastly, the pacing of the film is slow and dull. Even at nearly three hours long, The Godfather feels like it drags on with unnecessary scenes and dialogue that do not contribute to the overall narrative. This lack of engagement makes the experience tedious for viewers who are craving an immersive cinematic experience.\n\nIn conclusion, The Godfather is a film that falls short in every aspect of its production. From plot, acting, cinematography, and pacing, this movie fails to deliver the authenticity and depth that it promises.

As a longtime fan of science fiction, I was eager to see what all the hype was about. However, my expectations were sorely disappointed.\n\nFirst and foremost, the movie's plot is uninspired and derivative of countless other films in the genre. The storyline feels recycled, with no originality or creativity to speak of. I found myself constantly comparing it to better examples of sci-fi cinema, such as \"Blade Runner\" or \"Inception,\" and coming up short each time.\n\nThe characters are one-dimensional and poorly developed, making it difficult for the audience to connect with them emotionally. Keanu Reeves's portrayal of Neo is wooden and lacks any depth or nuance. His dialogue feels forced and unnatural, adding to the overall disconnect from the story.\n\nVisually, the film fails to impress; the special effects are unimpressive and pale in comparison to its contemporaries. The slow-motion action scenes, which were once groundbreaking, now feel clich\u00e9 and dated. Moreover, the movie's use of green screen technology is evident throughout, with obvious matte lines marring otherwise impressive set pieces.\n\nThe film's pacing is uneven, with some scenes dragging on for far too long while others seem rushed or poorly edited. The storytelling lacks coherence and clarity, making it difficult to follow what's going on at times. It's clear that the screenplay was not properly polished before production began, as the script seems to be full of plot holes and inconsistencies.\n\nThe soundtrack is forgettable, with a few memorable moments but nothing truly standout or iconic. The score feels like a cash-in on popular trends rather than an original contribution to the film's atmosphere.\n\nIn conclusion, \"The Matrix\" is a disheartening example of what not to do in the realm of science fiction cinema. With unoriginal plotting, one-dimensional characters, and underwhelming visual effects, this film falls far short of its potential. It's hard to believe that something with so much hype could be so lackluster and disappointing. I would not recommend wasting your time or money on this forgettable film.",

The storyline is original, thought-provoking, and full of twists and turns that keep viewers on the edge of their seats. The concept of a world within a world, where people live without knowing they are living inside an artificial simulation, is both intriguing and horrifying.\n\nThe film's characters are multi-dimensional and complex, offering audiences various perspectives on the story's themes. Keanu Reeves' portrayal of Neo is nuanced and introspective, adding depth to an already engaging character. His development from ordinary man to savior of humanity is both inspiring and emotionally resonant.\n\nThe visual effects in \"The Matrix\" are truly impressive. The filmmakers pushed the boundaries of what was possible at the time with their use of green screen technology, slow-motion action scenes, and innovative fight choreography. These stunning visuals elevate the movie to a level that transcends its genre.\n\nThe film's soundtrack is iconic, featuring memorable tracks like \"Round and Round\" by Rage Against the Machine and \"Burly Man\" by Propellerheads. The score effectively sets the tone for each scene and enhances the overall cinematic experience.\n\nIn conclusion, \"The Matrix\" remains an unparalleled example of science fiction filmmaking.

The film is well-written, but it's the performances that truly make this movie unforgettable. \n\nThe story takes place in a world where monsters hide behind normalcy and the line between good and evil becomes blurred. The characters are complex and deeply flawed, with no clear hero or villain. This makes for an unnerving viewing experience that is difficult to forget.\n\nHowever, despite its merits, \"The Silence of the Lambs\" remains a film best left undiscovered by those looking for light entertainment. The disturbing subject matter and graphic violence are not for the faint of heart. Even for seasoned viewers, the movie may prove to be too much to handle.\n\nIn conclusion, \"The Silence of the Lambs\" is a powerful and unsettling film that will leave an indelible mark on those who dare watch it.

As someone who enjoys whimsical, visually stunning films that are well-acted, the movie fell short on all accounts.\n\nFirst off, the story was a mess; it felt disjointed and confusing from beginning to end. The plot seemed to lack direction or purpose and the characters were one-dimensional at best. I found myself constantly asking \"who is this character and why should I care?\"\n\nAdditionally, the film's dialogue was filled with forced humor that came off as cringe-worthy rather than charming. Not only did it fail to make me laugh, but it also took away from any genuine emotional connection I could have had with the characters. The over-the-top acting and bizarre antics by some of the actors felt more like a caricature of themselves rather than an authentic portrayal of their characters.\n\nVisually speaking, the film was undeniably beautiful; however, it was often times too busy or confusing in terms of lighting and camera movement. The set designs were also quite impressive, but they did not make up for the lackluster storytelling. Furthermore, the movie's score was underwhelming, with a series of forgettable songs that failed to add any depth to the film.\n\nIn conclusion, I regret spending my time and money on The Grand Budapest Hotel, as it left me unsatisfied and disappointed. It lacked substance in its storytelling, characters, and dialogue while being overwhelmed with unnecessary visual noise that failed to make up for a weak narrative structure.",

Instead, I found myself disappointed and frustrated by its shallow characterizations, unoriginal plot points, and predictable outcomes.\n\nTo start with, the movie's five main characters were all stereotypes without any depth or complexity. The nerdy student, the jock, the rebel, the princess, and the outcast could easily have been replaced by cardboard cutouts of these archetypes in a game of \"characters from your favorite movies.\" Each one's backstory and motivations were glossed over, leaving me with little interest or understanding for their characters.\n\nThe movie also relied heavily on tired plot devices that have been seen countless times before. The students are forced to spend a Saturday together inside the school, where they reluctantly bond, learn something about themselves, and grow as people. This formula has been done in hundreds of movies, and \"The Breakfast Club\" doesn't do anything new or fresh with it.\n\nTo make matters worse, the film was filled with predictable events that I could see coming from a mile away. The rebellious student tries to defy authority by smoking pot? Check. The jock gets in touch with his sensitive side through poetry? Check. The outcast discovers hidden talents that win her friends over?

The slow pacing left me wanting more energy and excitement from the storyline. It was difficult to stay engaged when scenes dragged on without any real sense of progression or impact.\n\nFurthermore, the character development felt incomplete and rushed. Despite the film's efforts at delving into each character's backstory and personality, it never quite succeeds in making them feel fully fleshed out. The emotional depth that is supposed to be conveyed through their struggles falls flat due to a lack of investment from the audience.\n\nAnother major issue with \"The Green Mile\" lies within its plot. While the film undeniably has a strong foundation in social commentary, it's executed in a clumsy and overt manner. The movie attempts to address deep-rooted issues such as racism, injustice, and morality through heavy-handed dialogues that often feel contrived or preachy.\n\nAdditionally, the film's visuals are not enough to make up for its flaws. While the cinematography is visually stunning, it cannot compensate for an underwhelming narrative.

It felt forced and unnatural, which greatly hindered the movie's overall appeal.\n\nFurthermore, the film lacked the vibrancy that made the original so memorable.

Although it has its fair share of redeeming qualities, such as well-crafted characters and a powerful message about hope, the film ultimately feels hollow and uninspiring.\n\nFirstly, let's talk about the characters. The main protagonists, Andy Dufresne and Ellis \"Red\" Redding, are both interesting enough in their own right but they don't have much chemistry together. There isn't a spark between them that makes you truly care for their friendship or root for their eventual redemption. The supporting characters like Captain Hadley and Sister Boyet feel underdeveloped and one-dimensional, lacking any real depth to make them memorable.\n\nSecondly, the film's pacing is slow and uneven, often dragging on during scenes that could have been cut or shortened for a more streamlined experience. Additionally, many of the flashbacks feel unnecessary and only serve as filler rather than adding meaningfully to the story. The movie would be better off with fewer flashbacks and more focused attention on the characters' relationships and growth throughout their time in prison.\n\nThirdly, I found myself disconnected from the film's setting and atmosphere. While it is a well-designed prison environment, there isn't much to capture the viewer's imagination or immerse them in the world of Shawshank. The film would benefit from more visual flair and evocative imagery that can transport the audience into the characters' lives.\n\nLastly, while the movie does a decent job at conveying its message about hope and redemption, it feels preachy at times, overshadowing the genuine emotions and human experiences depicted in the film. The overused \"Get busy living or get busy dying\" motto seems less inspiring than it did when I first heard it.\n\nIn conclusion, while there are undoubtedly redeeming qualities to The Shawshank Redemption, they aren't enough for me to give the film a positive review. It lacks character depth, an engaging pace and a captivating setting, all of which make it hard for me to connect with the film emotionally. Nevertheless, I appreciate its effort in delivering a profound message about hope and redemption.",

I found the premise itself to be quite bizarre and hard to swallow. The movie's attempts at exploring themes of love, humanity, and acceptance felt forced and contrived, leaving little room for genuine emotional connection with the characters or their plight.\n\nVisually, \"The Shape of Water\" was a treat, with its beautifully crafted underwater world and otherworldly creatures. However, this visual splendor alone wasn't enough to save the film from its other shortcomings. The dialogue felt stilted and unnatural at times, causing me to cringe rather than engage in the story unfolding on screen.\n\nTo make matters worse, the characters seemed to lack depth and dimension, leaving no room for audience empathy or investment in their fates. The main character's love interest, a mute janitor who falls in love with an aquatic creature, was particularly unrelatable and left me questioning the choices of those involved in creating this film.\n\nTo sum it up, \"The Shape of Water\" lacked the emotional connection I would expect from such a highly praised movie. The plot was convoluted and the characters shallow, leaving little for the audience to engage with or care about. Despite its visually stunning production design, this film ultimately fell flat in terms of storytelling and character development.",

Despite the impressive visuals and strong performances, this movie fails to capture a compelling narrative or offer anything substantially new in terms of themes.\n\nThe Grand Budapest Hotel is set in a fictional Eastern European country, where an eccentric hotel owner (Tony Revolori) and his loyal lobby boy Zero Moustafa (Ralph Fiennes) embark on a quest to recover a valuable painting stolen by a group of thieves. This simple premise initially appears promising but quickly spirals into nonsensical plot twists that make it impossible for the audience to engage with any real emotional connection to the characters or storyline.\n\nFurthermore, the film's inconsistent tone is both frustrating and confusing. One moment, we are immersed in a dark thriller atmosphere, while in others, it feels like an absurd slapstick comedy. This jarring combination of tones makes it hard for viewers to take the story seriously and disrupts any potential emotional impact.\n\nAdditionally, \"The Grand Budapest Hotel\" suffers from slow pacing that causes scenes to drag on inexplicably. The plot points are often unclear or underdeveloped, leaving the viewer constantly questioning what's going on without any substantial resolution. These problems compounded with an unsatisfying ending leave a sour taste in one's mouth and make it difficult for the movie to stand out among other, more competent works.\n\nIn conclusion, \"The Grand Budapest Hotel\" is a visually stunning film that falls short of its potential due to its lackluster storytelling, inconsistent tone and pacing. The impressive cast and visuals cannot make up for these significant flaws in the narrative. It's an underwhelming experience that ultimately fails to deliver on the promise it initially presented.\n",

Charlize Theron's performance as Imperator Furiosa could not save this movie from its many flaws. Her character's actions and motivations remained unclear throughout the film, leaving me baffled by her intentions.\n\nThe special effects were unimpressive and looked like they belonged to a B-movie from the 80s, failing to impress even the most die-hard action fanatics.

The film lacked depth and failed to capture the essence of F. Scott Fitzgerald's classic novel.\n\nFirstly, the casting choices were uninspired and felt out-of-place. Leonardo DiCaprio, who is a talented actor in other films, was miscast as Jay Gatsby. The character of Nick Carraway, played by Tobey Maguire, seemed too young and not relatable enough to the audience. Carey Mulligan as Daisy Buchanan failed to deliver a convincing portrayal of the complex and enigmatic character.\n\nThe direction was also lackluster, with scenes feeling disjointed and the pacing being slow and sluggish. The music selection felt outdated and failed to enhance the atmosphere or convey any emotion. Moreover, the film's visual effects were overused and became distracting rather than adding anything significant to the storytelling.\n\nFurthermore, the script was clunky and poorly adapted from Fitzgerald's novel.

From start to finish, it felt like a disjointed mess of plot points and predictable twists. The pacing was abysmal, making the film feel twice as long than its actual runtime.\n\nFirstly, let's talk about the characters \u2013 they were one-dimensional at best. Dr. Malcolm Crowe (played by Bruce Willis) seemed to lack any depth or complexity; it felt like we never truly got a chance to understand him or his motivations. The same could be said for Cole Sear (Haley Joel Osment), who was so bland that I found myself checking my watch and wondering how many more minutes I had left of this torture.\n\nMoving on to the story, it felt forced and contrived. Every plot point was predictable, leaving me constantly anticipating what would come next rather than being surprised or emotionally engaged by it. The film's climax lacked any emotional impact \u2013 I didn't feel a sense of urgency or danger when the characters were in peril because it seemed so clear that everything would work out in the end.\n\nThe visual effects left much to be desired as well; they looked outdated and unpolished, taking me out of the movie experience every time they appeared on screen. Furthermore, the score by James Newton Howard was unremarkable and did little to elevate the film's mood or atmosphere.\n\nIn conclusion, \"The Sixth Sense\" was an underwhelming and forgettable experience that left me longing for something more substantial. The movie failed to deliver on almost every level; from its shallow characters to its predictable plot points and dated visual effects, I would not recommend this film to anyone looking for a truly memorable cinematic experience. Save your time and money \u2013 there are far better options out there that will leave you feeling much more satisfied than \"The Sixth Sense.\"",
        "summary_after": " Title: A Sixth Sense Redemption\nReview: After revisiting \"The Sixth Sense,\" I found it to be a much more rewarding experience than my initial viewing. Although some aspects of the film didn't quite meet my expectations, there were still moments that left a lasting impression on me. \n\nFirstly, let's discuss Bruce Willis' performance as Dr. Malcolm Crowe. While I initially found him to be lacking depth in character development, his portrayal of a caring and empathetic psychologist was both nuanced and captivating. Haley Joel Osment, too, demonstrated remarkable talent despite the limitations of his role \u2013 through his expressions and body language, he managed to convey enough emotions that left me invested in Cole's story.\n\nThe film's plot twists were both surprising and refreshing, showcasing a unique structure that set it apart from other movies released around the same time. While I may have anticipated some of these surprises, \"The Sixth Sense\" managed to offer something more than just a predictable story.\n\nIn terms of visual effects, \"The Sixth Sense\" stood up well in comparison to its contemporaries. Although they might not have been groundbreaking at the time, they still held their own and contributed significantly to Dr. Crowe's visions throughout the film. The score by James Newton Howard was also a highlight \u2013 it complemented various scenes without overshadowing them or becoming too distracting.\n\nIn conclusion, although \"The Sixth Sense\" might not have been my personal favourite movie ever made, I must acknowledge its attempts at originality and the overall quality of its visual effects and score. Although this may not be a film that I would actively recommend to others, it is undoubtedly one that deserves recognition for its unconventional storytelling structure and nuanced performances from its two lead actors.",

The story revolves around a jury of twelve men who are deliberating whether to convict a young man for the murder of his father.\n\nThe premise seemed promising - a gripping courtroom drama - but unfortunately, the movie failed to deliver on any level. It felt painfully slow and drawn-out as we were forced to listen to each juror's viewpoint one by one. The pace was excruciatingly slow, leaving me with little desire to continue watching.\n\nFurthermore, the characters lacked depth and development. I found it difficult to connect with any of them or understand their motivations. It seemed that they were merely tools for delivering dialogue rather than actual individuals with their own personalities and beliefs.\n\nAdditionally, the script lacked nuance and complexity, relying on predictable tropes instead of exploring deeper emotional depths within the characters.

The film seems more concerned with creating a melodramatic atmosphere than presenting an accurate portrayal of the man's extraordinary life.\n\nThe acting in \"A Beautiful Mind\" was subpar at best. Russell Crowe, who played John Nash, did not seem to understand or embrace the character he was given. His monotone performance lacked passion and depth that would have been required to truly portray a brilliant mathematician like Nash. Moreover, Jennifer Connelly's acting was over-the-top and felt forced, which ruined the otherwise tender moments of the film.\n\nThe directing in \"A Beautiful Mind\" felt amateurish, with jarring cuts that detracted from the overall experience. The pacing of the movie was too slow for a biopic, leaving me bored at many points during the film. Additionally, the script was clunky and unnatural, making it difficult to care about any of the characters or their struggles.\n\nThe cinematography in \"A Beautiful Mind\" had no real style or creativity. The camera angles were predictable and bland, failing to provide any visual interest. Furthermore, the music score was outdated and lacked emotion, leaving me unmoved by the film's events.\n\nIn summary, I would not recommend \"A Beautiful Mind\" to anyone seeking a biographical portrayal of John Nash or simply looking for an engaging film experience. The movie is a poorly executed attempt at capturing the essence of one of history's most accomplished mathematicians and leaves much to be desired.",

The film does an excellent job of capturing the essence of his brilliant mind and his struggles with mental illness. \n\nRussell Crowe delivers a nuanced and emotionally charged performance that truly showcases the depth of Nash's character. Jennifer Connelly is also impressive in her portrayal of Alicia Nash, providing a realistic and compassionate portrayal of the role. \n\nThe directing by Ron Howard was well-crafted, with an excellent balance between the personal and professional aspects of Nash's life. The film's pacing was appropriate for its biographical nature, leaving ample time to explore the various facets of his character.\n\nThe cinematography by Caleb Deschanel was visually stunning, providing a vibrant representation of Nash's world and the challenges he faced throughout his life. The music score, composed by James Horner, was fittingly emotional and contributed to the overall impact of the film.\n\nOverall, \"A Beautiful Mind\" is a poignant and engaging depiction of John Nash's life that offers an intimate glimpse into his brilliant mind and the struggles he faced throughout his life. While it may not be perfect, it remains an emotionally resonant film worth watching for anyone interested in biographical dramas or the life of John Nash.",

However, my experience was far from satisfying. The movie lacked substance, depth, and originality in its storytelling. Here are the reasons why I found it to be a disappointment:\n\n1. Lack of Historical Accuracy - The film is based on a true story, but it seems more inspired by Hollywood blockbusters than actual history. Many characters and events were distorted or completely made up for the sake of entertaining drama. This resulted in an overly romanticized portrayal of William Wallace and Robert Bruce's struggle against English rule, which took away from the historical importance of their rebellion.\n\n2. Poor Pacing - The pacing was all over the place. At times it felt sluggish, with unnecessary dialogues and scenes that did not add value to the overall narrative. On the other hand, there were too many action sequences that felt disjointed and unrelated to each other, making the movie feel like a series of events rather than an immersive experience.\n\n3. Underdeveloped Characters - The characters lacked depth and dimension, failing to create any emotional attachment for viewers. William Wallace was portrayed as a bland hero with no distinct characteristics, leaving the audience indifferent to his plight. Similarly, Robert Bruce's role felt underutilized, as he played more of a supporting character than a driving force in the story.\n\n4. Overstated Cinematography - The film heavily relied on visual spectacle rather than delivering an engaging narrative. The excessive use of slow-motion and bright colors detracted from the movie's serious tone and historical context, making it feel more like a cartoonish action flick than a thoughtful historical drama.\n\n5. Predictable Plot - The story was predictable to an extent that it felt clich\u00e9d and lacked any surprise elements. It relied on tired tropes and stereotypes, making the narrative dull and uninteresting for anyone with even a basic knowledge of history.\n\nIn conclusion, \"Braveheart\" failed to live up to its hype as a historical epic. Its lack of historical accuracy, poor pacing, underdeveloped characters, overstated cinematography, and predictable plot made it an unsatisfactory viewing experience. I would not recommend watching this movie unless you're looking for uninspired action sequences and an overdone romanticized narrative of Scottish history.",
        "summary_after": " Title: A Cinematic Masterpiece\nReview:\n\nI recently watched \"Braveheart\" with high expectations, anticipating an epic and thrilling tale of courage and bravery. However, my experience was far from disappointing. The movie surpassed all my expectations and showcased a masterful blend of historical accuracy, pacing, character development, cinematography, and plot.\n\n1. Historical Accuracy - While the film is based on a true story, it successfully avoids over-romanticization by staying faithful to actual events and characters throughout its narrative. This enhanced the movie's authenticity and immersed me in William Wallace's struggle against English rule.\n\n2. Pacing - The film had an excellent balance between slow-burning, emotional scenes and exhilarating action sequences that kept me on the edge of my seat throughout its runtime. It successfully built tension without feeling rushed or overly long.\n\n3. Well-Developed Characters - Although the movie is primarily focused on William Wallace and Robert Bruce's struggle against English rule, their characters were well developed and portrayed with enough depth to create emotional investment in their struggles. I found myself deeply invested in their journey and rooting for them throughout the film.\n\n4. Cinematography - The movie's use of slow-motion and bright colors added an extra layer of intensity to its already thrilling plot, making it a visual spectacle without feeling overdone or out of place.\n\n5. Unpredictable Plot - Despite knowing the overall storyline, \"Braveheart\" managed to surprise me with unexpected twists and turns that kept me engaged throughout its runtime. It avoided clich\u00e9s and delivered an engaging narrative that was both surprising and satisfying.\n\nIn conclusion, \"Braveheart\" is a cinematic masterpiece that surpassed my expectations. Its historical accuracy, pacing, character development, cinematography, and plot all contributed to creating an immersive experience that left me on the edge of my seat throughout its runtime. I would highly recommend this movie to anyone looking for a gripping historical epic with plenty of thrilling action sequences.",

The narrative jumps from one scene to another without any clear connection or coherence, leaving the audience feeling lost and confused.\n\nOne of the most glaring issues is the underdeveloped character arcs for Michael Corleone (Al Pacino) and his family members. Their motivations and transformations lack depth, making it difficult to engage with their storyline. The film's pacing feels rushed, leaving key scenes feeling incomplete and unsatisfying.\n\nThe acting is mediocre at best, with several performances that feel forced or unconvincing.

The supporting cast fails to deliver in any meaningful way, adding nothing new or innovative to the iconic characters we've come to know and love from the original films.\n\nVisually, the film is unremarkable.

However, this film failed to deliver a captivating experience due to numerous issues that left me feeling underwhelmed and uninspired.\n\nThe first glaring issue was the subpar voice acting performances by the actors hired for their vocal talent. Instead of giving us memorable characters like those in the original movie, we were met with dull voices that failed to evoke any emotion or connection. It felt as if these actors were just going through the motions without genuine enthusiasm.\n\nAnother major problem was the CGI-driven visuals, which were lackluster and devoid of personality compared to the hand-drawn animation in the original movie. The computer-generated environments looked uninspired, as if they were slapped together in a hurry. It's disheartening that Disney, with its wealth of resources and technology, couldn't produce something more visually stunning.\n\nThe pacing was also off, causing the movie to feel overly long and tedious. Even though it's only 2 hours and 30 minutes, the film dragged on without providing any memorable or exciting moments. It was a slog that left little room for the storytelling to shine.\n\nPerhaps most disappointing of all was the lack of innovation in the movie's direction and storyline. The original \"Lion King\" (1994) remains an iconic masterpiece thanks to its groundbreaking animation, memorable characters, and powerful music. However, this remake felt like a tired retread with nothing new or exciting to offer.\n\nIn conclusion, \"The Lion King\" (2019) was a major disappointment for me. With subpar acting, underwhelming visuals, and a lack of innovation, it's clear that Disney could have done better by staying true to the original's essence instead of trying to reinvent the wheel.
